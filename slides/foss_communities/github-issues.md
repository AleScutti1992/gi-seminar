# GitHub issues, AKA, the very last resource

GitHub implements a bug tracking system that helps developers to prioritize the issues and define milestones.

Each project has it's own style of managing the issues but there is one general rule: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

### Don't use GitHub issues to ask for support, first try the above mentioned channels. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
