# What the ideal PR should contain

A pull requests can be a bug fix, a feature add, documentation change etc.

In case of feature add (most complete example), a PR should have:

* a clean code with addition (no typos, no pep8 violations, see travis-ci)
* a suite of tests that possibly cover all the written code (see coveralls)
* the documentation
* a good description with the reference of the improvement proposal or GitHub issue requesting its implementation
